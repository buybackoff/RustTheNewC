/**
  Compress a block of data in the `src` buffer and returns the size of
  the compressed block.  The size of `src` buffer is specified by
  `nbytes`.  There is not a minimum for `src` buffer size (`nbytes`).

  `clevel` is the desired compression level and must be a number
  between 0 (no compression) and 9 (maximum compression).

  `doshuffle` specifies whether the shuffle compression filters
  should be applied or not.  BLOSC_NOSHUFFLE means not applying it,
  BLOSC_SHUFFLE means applying it at a byte level and BLOSC_BITSHUFFLE
  at a bit level (slower but may achieve better entropy alignment).

  `typesize` is the number of bytes for the atomic type in binary
  `src` buffer.  This is mainly useful for the shuffle filters.
  For implementation reasons, only a 1 < `typesize` < 256 will allow the
  shuffle filter to work.  When `typesize` is not in this range, shuffle
  will be silently disabled.

  The `dest` buffer must have at least the size of `destsize`.  Blosc
  guarantees that if you set `destsize` to, at least,
  (`nbytes` + BLOSC_MAX_OVERHEAD), the compression will always succeed.
  The `src` buffer and the `dest` buffer can not overlap.

  Compression is memory safe and guaranteed not to write the `dest`
  buffer beyond what is specified in `destsize`.

  If `src` buffer cannot be compressed into `destsize`, the return
  value is zero and you should discard the contents of the `dest`
  buffer.

  A negative return value means that an internal error happened.  This
  should never happen.  If you see this, please report it back
  together with the buffer data causing this and compression settings.

  Environment variables
  ---------------------

  blosc_compress() honors different environment variables to control
  internal parameters without the need of doing that programatically.
  Here are the ones supported:

  BLOSC_CLEVEL=(INTEGER): This will overwrite the `clevel` parameter
  before the compression process starts.

  BLOSC_SHUFFLE=[NOSHUFFLE | SHUFFLE | BITSHUFFLE]: This will
  overwrite the `doshuffle` parameter before the compression process
  starts.

  BLOSC_TYPESIZE=(INTEGER): This will overwrite the `typesize`
  parameter before the compression process starts.

  BLOSC_COMPRESSOR=[BLOSCLZ | LZ4 | LZ4HC | SNAPPY | ZLIB]: This will
  call blosc_set_compressor(BLOSC_COMPRESSOR) before the compression
  process starts.

  BLOSC_NTHREADS=(INTEGER): This will call
  blosc_set_nthreads(BLOSC_NTHREADS) before the compression process
  starts.

  BLOSC_BLOCKSIZE=(INTEGER): This will call
  blosc_set_blocksize(BLOSC_BLOCKSIZE) before the compression process
  starts.  *NOTE:* The blocksize is a critical parameter with
  important restrictions in the allowed values, so use this with care.

  BLOSC_NOLOCK=(ANY VALUE): This will call blosc_compress_ctx() under
  the hood, with the `compressor`, `blocksize` and
  `numinternalthreads` parameters set to the same as the last calls to
  blosc_set_compressor(), blosc_set_blocksize() and
  blosc_set_nthreads().  BLOSC_CLEVEL, BLOSC_SHUFFLE, BLOSC_TYPESIZE
  environment vars will also be honored.

  BLOSC_SPLITMODE=[ FORWARD_COMPAT | AUTO | ALWAYS | NEVER ]:
  This will call blosc_set_splitmode() with the different supported values.
  See blosc_set_splitmode() docstrings for more info on each mode.
